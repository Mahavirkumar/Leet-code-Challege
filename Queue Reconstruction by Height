Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers (h, k), where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.
code


class Solution {
    public int[][] reconstructQueue(int[][] people) {
        Arrays.sort(people,(a,b)->{
           return (a[0]==b[0])?a[1]-b[1]:b[0]-a[0];  //sort accrding to height
        });
        List<int[]> al=new ArrayList<>();
        
        for(int x[]:people)
            al.add(x[1],x);
            
            return al.toArray(new int[people.length][2]);
        
    }
}
